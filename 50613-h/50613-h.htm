<p class="drop-cap"><i>THERE</i> was skating on the ponds where
the snow had been cleared; there were
icicles on the trees, nice blue, clear skies
in the daytime, cold, bright, wintry moonlight
at night.</p>

<p>Lovely weather for Christmas holidays!
But to one little five-year-old man, nothing
had seemed lovely this Christmas, though
he was spending it with his Father and
Mother and his big sisters at Grandpapa’s
beautiful old country-house, where everybody
did all that could be done to make
Grandpapa’s guests happy.</p>

<p>For poor little Roger was pining for
his elder brother, Lawson, whom he had not
seen for more than four months. Lawson
was eight, and had been at school since
Michaelmas, and there he had caught a
fever which had made it not safe for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to join the rest of the family till the middle
of January. But he was coming to-morrow.</p>

<p>Why, then, did Roger still look sad
and gloomy?</p>

<p>“Stupid little boy,” said Mabel. “I’m
sure we’ve tried to amuse him. Why,
Mamma let him sit up an hour later than
usual last night, to hear all those funny
old fairy tales and legends Uncle Bob was
telling.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and weren’t they fun?” answered
Pansy. “I did shiver at the witch ones,
though, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>Poor little Roger! Pansy’s shivering
was nothing to his! They had all walked
home from the Vicarage, tempted by the
clear frosty moonlight, and the hard, dry
ground; and trotting along, a little behind
the others, a strange thing had happened
to the boy. Fancy—in the field by the
Primrose Lane, through the gateway, right
in a bright band of moonlight, <i>he had seen
a witch!</i> Just such a witch as Uncle Bob
had described—with shadowy garments, and
outstretched arms, and a queer-shaped head,
on all of which the icicles were sparkling,
just as Uncle Bob had said. For it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
a winter-witch he had told the story about,
whose dwelling was up in the frozen
northern seas; “the Snow Witch” they
called her.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">
<img src="images/illus011.jpg" width="315" height="295" alt="Children building snowman" />
</div>

<p>Cold as it was, Roger was in a bath
of heat, his heart beating wildly, his legs
shaking, when he overtook his sisters. And
the night that followed was full of terrible
dreams and starts, and misery, even though
nurse and Baby were next door, and he
could see the nightlight through the chinks.</p>

<p>If it had not been that Lawson was
coming—Lawson, who never laughed at him
or called him “stupid little goose”; Lawson,
who listened to all his griefs—Roger could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
not have borne it. For, strange to say, the
little fellow told no one of his trouble; he
felt as if he could <i>only</i> tell Lawson.</p>

<p>No wonder he looked pale and sad and
spiritless; there was still another dreadful
night to get through before Lawson came.</p>

<p>But things sometimes turn out better
than our fears. Late that afternoon, when
nursery tea was over and bed-time not far
off, there came the sound of wheels and
then a joyful hubbub. Lawson had come!
Uncle Bob had been passing near the
school where he was, and had gone a little
out of his way to pick him up. Everyone
was delighted—though of them all, <i>none</i> so
thankful as Roger.</p>

<p>“Though I won’t tell him to-night,”
decided the unselfish little fellow, “not to
spoil his first night. I shan’t mind when
I know he’s in his cot beside me.” And
even when Lawson asked him if anything
were the matter, he kept to his resolution.</p>

<p>But he awoke in the middle of the
night from a terrible dream; Lawson awoke
too, and then—out it all came. “I thought
she was coming in at the window,” Roger
ended. “If—if you look out—it’s moonlight—I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
think <i>p’r’aps</i> you’ll see where she stands.
But no, no; don’t—<i>don’t;</i> she might see you.”</p>

<p>So Lawson agreed to wait till to-morrow.
“You go to sleep,” he said. “<i>I’m</i> here, and
you can say your prayers again if you like.”</p>

<p>Lawson was up very early next morning.
When breakfast was over he told Roger to
come out with him. Down the Primrose
Lane they went, in spite of Roger’s trembling.</p>

<p>“Now, shut your eyes,” said Lawson,
when they got to the gate. He opened it,
and led his brother through.</p>

<p>“Look, now!” he said, with a merry
laugh. And what do you think Roger saw?</p>

<p>An old scarecrow, forgotten since last
year. There she stood, the “Snow Witch”—an
apron and ragged shawl, two sticks
for arms, a bit of Grandpapa’s hat to crown
all—that was the witch!</p>

<p>“Shake hands with her, Roger,” said
Lawson. And shake hands they both did,
till the old scarecrow tumbled to pieces,
never more to frighten either birds or little
boys. “Dear Lawson,” said Roger lovingly,
as he held up his little face for a kiss.
And happy, indeed, were the rest of the
Christmas holidays.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory'>“YOU mustn’t go into the
dining-room, children,”
said Mother, popping her
head in at the school-room
door.</p>

<p>“All right, Mother!”
Jack and Dorothy and
Eva called after her, but Jim didn’t say
anything.</p>

<p>He was the naughty boy of the family,
and went by the name of “Jim the Terrible,”
and I am afraid he very often deserved his
name.</p>

<p>When the others went to say good
night to Mother, Jim paused outside the
dining-room door; it was open just the
least little bit in the world, and he peeped
in and saw a wonderful tree, standing in
the middle of the room, laden with toys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>Right at the top hung a Punch doll,
dressed in satin and tinsel, and he shone
and glittered so that Jim could see him
better than the other toys.</p>

<p>But his Mother called to him, so he
could not wait to examine the tree more
closely.</p>

<p>When the children were in bed Jim
made up his mind to lie awake, and as
soon as the others were asleep, he stole
softly downstairs to have another look at
the Christmas-tree.</p>

<p>The room was a blaze of light now,
and the Punch doll at the top shook his
staff at Jim as soon as he entered.</p>

<p>“Oh! you naughty boy,” he cried.
“You Terrible Jim. What do you mean
by coming here when your Mother told you
not to go near the dining-room! I’ll teach
you to disobey! Oh—o—o—o—! Go to
bed! go to bed!”</p>

<p>All the while Punch was speaking he
was growing larger and larger, until at last
he seemed as big as the giant in the
pantomime, and then he gave a terrific
jump from the top of the tree, and began
to chase Jim upstairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Oh! how the little boy ran, with Punch
close behind him all the time.</p>

<p>At length he reached the nursery, and
with a bound sprang into his bed and
tucked the clothes up round him. There
he lay trembling for ever such a time, but
when at length he ventured to peep out,
the nursery was quite dark, and Punch had
evidently gone away, so he curled himself
up and went to sleep.</p>

<p>The next day when the children were
called in to the forbidden room, they simply
danced and screamed with delight when they
saw the beautiful Christmas-tree.</p>

<p>At least all except Jim, for when he
looked at the Punch doll on the top of
the tree, it seemed to him that it was
frowning at him, and he made up his mind
<i>never</i> to peep through cracks of doors again,
when it was forbidden him, however much
he might want to know what was behind
them.</p>

<p>Now, before he had made this good
resolution he had been thoroughly miserable.</p>

<p>He could take no pleasure at all in the
beautiful presents which Mother gathered
for them from the Christmas-tree, for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the time he was watching the Punch doll
to see if he would come down from his
perch and chase him upstairs again.</p>

<p>No sooner did he resolve to be a
better boy in future than the expression on
Punch’s face changed in a most surprising
manner: he seemed almost to smile at
Jimmy.</p>

everything except Punch, and the children
were busy pulling the plums out of the big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
snapdragon Father had lighted, Jimmy
fancied the old fellow nodded his head at
him once or twice in a friendly fashion,
and the little boy was so relieved and
happy that he clapped his hands for joy,
and shouted with the rest.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2">THERE was once a poor old
pedlar who sold ribbons and
brooches and tapes and needles;
his hair was long and his
back was bent, and perhaps
he did look rather strange;
but that was no reason why
the boys should have called
him names and thrown stones at him as
he went through the village. At last a
stone hit him on the forehead and he fell
on the dusty road, and the bad boys ran
away, afraid of what they had done. But
one boy named Jack had seen the thing
from a field some way off, and now he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
came running up, and bathed the poor old
man’s head and spoke kindly to him, and
when the pedlar was better he said: “You
are a good boy and you may have what
you like out of my pack.”</p>

<p>Now, Jack did not like to take anything
valuable out of a poor man’s pack,
so he looked at all the pretty things, and
then he picked out an old knife.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 493px;">
<img src="images/illus019.jpg" width="493" height="326" alt="Pedlar sitting in road talking to Jack" />
</div>

<p>The pedlar laughed. “You have chosen
the most valuable thing I have,” he said;
“that knife will cut through iron or stone
as easily as through butter.”</p>

<p>“Oh! then,” said Jack hastily, “let me
have these old spectacles.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The pedlar laughed louder than ever.</p>

<p>“Those spectacles will make you see to
any part of the world, and see through
stone or iron as easily as through glass,”
he said; “there—take both!”</p>

<p>And putting the two into Jack’s hand
he vanished—and he did it quite easily,
because he was a magician.</p>

<p>So now Jack’s fortune was made; he
could see where gold and precious stones
lay under the earth and he could cut away
the rocks that covered them as though they
were butter.</p>

<p>So he was rewarded for his kind-heartedness.</p>

<p>But the greatest reward of all came to
him when the Princess of that land was
carried off and hidden by an enchanter.
And the King, after vainly offering all sorts
of other prizes, at last said that any man
who could find the Princess and set her
free should marry her.</p>

<p>So Jack put on his spectacles and saw
the Princess sitting crying in a lonely tower.
It was a year’s journey off, but he made
the journey, and wherever he was, he put
on his spectacles again and looked at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
beautiful Princess, and that gave him
courage.</p>

<p>At last he came to the tower, and with
his magic knife he cut through the iron
door and set the Princess free, and with the
same knife he killed the wicked enchanter.</p>

<p>Then he took the Princess home in
triumph and the grateful pedlar came to the
wedding-feast.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">SHE was lost as they went through
the wood. How it happened
nobody quite knew, but they
supposed she must have tumbled
out of the perambulator as Kitty
pushed it through the ferns and long grasses,
and so poor Dolly was left there, lying on
her back, staring up at as much sky as
was visible through the fern-fronds, and the
foxglove leaves, and the branches of the
trees overhead.</p>

<p>Would they come back for her? The
children’s voices and footsteps grew fainter
and fainter, till at last they died quite
away in the distance, and the robin began
singing again on the branch over her head.
Presently the little bird caught sight of
Dolly, and flew down and looked at her
with his bright eyes, and then a tiny <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>field-mouse
ran round and over her with her
little light paws—which must have tickled,
but still Dolly never moved, and a wise old
beetle came out of his hole, and twiddled
his long whiskers as he peered at her
curiously.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 543px;">
<img src="images/illus023.jpg" width="543" height="417" alt="Doll lost in long grass little girl looking" />
</div>

<p>“Sweet! sweet!” said the robin. “Who
is she?”</p>

<p>“Twee! twee!” whispered the mouse.
“I don’t know!”</p>

<p>“Hum, hu-um!” buzzed the beetle.
“Why doesn’t she speak?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>But Dolly didn’t say a word!</p>

<p>Now, eventide came, and the sun grew
tired, and put himself to bed under a
crimson-and-gold counterpane. The robin
found a comfortable twig on which to perch,
and tucked his head under his wing. The
mouse went home to her babies, of whom
she had six—all packed warm and tight in
a neat little nest hung on to a cornstalk
in the next field. And the beetle spread
his shining wings and went for a fly round
before he, too, rolled himself in a roseleaf
blanket and went to sleep! But Dolly never
closed her eyes!</p>

<p>Then the great stars lit their lamps,
and looked down at her through the fern-fronds,
but if they said anything no one
heard them—they were too far off!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Dolly, dear Dolly, where are you?”
cried a little voice, and little footsteps came
pressing through the tall bracken fern.</p>

<p>But Dolly didn’t answer!</p>

<p>“Dolly! Dolly! Oh! I wish I could
find my Dolly!” There were tears in the
little voice now, and the footsteps were more
hurried. Yet Dolly lay still!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>The sobs grew louder and louder, the
little feet almost touched Dolly as she lay
hidden under the big foxglove; then the
little steps went on, and the sobs grew
fainter in the distance, and Dolly lay still
staring up at the sky!</p>

<p>So the days went by, and the winter
came, and the falling leaves drifted over
Dolly, and the snow covered her, but she
never moved nor shivered—till one day in
spring-time a great wind arose, which blew
all the dead dry leaves away in little rustling
dances—and lo! John the woodman caught
sight of Dolly’s pink cheeks and blue eyes
still staring up at the sky!</p>

<p>“Why,” he exclaimed, “I do believe
there’s little missie’s doll, as she fretted so
at losing!”</p>

<p>And he took Dolly home in his pocket!</p>

<p class="drop-capi">EFFIE was quite in
distress about the
spare room in her
doll’s-house, because
she had no “visitor
doll.”</p>

<p>All the other
rooms were occupied,
for there were
two smart maids
in the kitchen who were beginning to cook
the dinner; then in the dining-room there
was a “mamma” sitting on the blue sofa,
gazing at the bowl of gold-fish. In the
nursery, the three children were already put
to bed, and the poor, tired nurse rested by
the bright coal-scuttle on the floor. In the
drawing-room, two gay dolls in ball-dresses
sat by the piano; but there was no one
for the spare room!</p>

<p>“It seems a great pity,” said Mamma,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
“because you put all the nicest things in
this room, Effie—the wax candles, the pretty
box of chocolates, the lace curtains to the
bed, and the dumb-bells; we must try and
think of someone to come and stay here.”</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 476px;">
<img src="images/illus027.jpg" width="476" height="460" alt="Effie playing with her large dollhouse" />
</div>

<p>“Mamma, do you think Rosie would
lend me one of her dolls?” suggested Effie.</p>

<p>“Supposing you write and ask her,”
said Mamma.</p>

<p>Effie seemed to think this a good idea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
but then she would have to wait a few
days, because her friend was away, staying
at a farmhouse.</p>

<p>“Shall we put the china baby in,” said
Mamma, “or is he quite one of the family?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mummy, he’s the youngest child
of all!” replied Effie, shaking her head.</p>

<p>“I am afraid he is too much of a
baby,” said Mamma, looking into the spare
room, “and he might get into the shower-bath
or open the door of the bird-cage—perhaps
it would be unsafe.”</p>

<p>Effie nodded.</p>

<p>“We will write to Rosie, then,” said
Mamma encouragingly.</p>

<p>That night, when Effie was fast asleep,
a little grey mouse peeped through a crack
in the nursery floor, and seeing that the
room was empty, she hurried into every
corner to find some chance crumb of cake
or bread, but alas for her! the room had
been too carefully swept, so the hungry little
mouse could find nothing for her supper.</p>

<p>Suddenly, she saw the dolls’-house, so
she squeezed through the glass door, which
Effie had not quite shut, and very soon
found her way into the spare room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i>The very thing!</i>” cried she to herself,
whisking her tail with joy. “Here is a nice
little bed to sleep in, and a wax candle on
the dressing-table for supper! How lucky
I am! this is indeed a nice house to visit!”</p>

<p>The next morning, Effie ran to her dolls’-house
and gave a little scream. “Mummy,<i>
look!</i> there’s been a mouse in the spare
room! It’s eaten two of the candles—look!”</p>

<p>“That is not quite the guest you hoped
for, is it, Effie?” said Mamma.</p>

<p>“No, but do you think it will come
again to-night? Oh! I should like to see
it in the morning!” said Effie.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">A &nbsp; GAILY-TINTED little
flower once lived in the
corner of a field. No other
flowers grew near, and she
often felt sad and lonely.
But one day a beautiful butterfly
hovered over her head and began
to talk to her. Presently he alighted
upon one of her leaves, and gazed admiringly
into her sweet face. The flower felt very
happy, and said: “How good it is of you
to stop here and talk to me!”</p>

<p>“I must be going soon,” replied the
butterfly. “How I wish that you could fly
away with me! You have no idea how
delightful it is to flit about in the air!”</p>

<p>“It must indeed be nice!” replied the
little flower. “But I cannot fly, for, as you
see, I have no wings, and besides, my stalk
holds me fast to the ground. So I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
to stay always in one place. I must just
make the best of it,” added she, trying to
be brave, although her heart ached at the
thought of parting with her winged friend.</p>

<p>Then a kind little Fairy popped up out
of the grass, and said: “I have been listening
to your talk. If you, fair flower, would
indeed like to fly away with your friend,
I will give you a pair of wings like mine.”</p>

<p>Then the Fairy touched the flower with
her wand, and she sprang from her stalk,
with two gauze-like wings to bear her up.
She looked now something like the butterfly,
only even more beautiful. The two
friends flew away together over the fields,
and the Fairy returned to Fairyland, feeling
very happy because she had been able to
please the little flower.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THERE was once a little
yellowy-brown rabbit, who
was so proud that there
was no bearing him. He
ran away from home and
went to live with some
strange rabbits. “I have
a right to be proud,” he
said, “because my parents
are Belgian hares.” But he looked so exactly
like the other rabbits that no one believed
him, and they turned him out for boasting.</p>

<p>So he went to live in the cucumber-frame,
and as the gardener did not notice
him he had rather a good time of it. But
presently the cucumbers were all over, and
then the gardener shut up the frame and
went away. And then the bunny grew
hungrier and hungrier, and he cried aloud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
but no one would help him. “It serves
him right for being so proud,” said the
other rabbits.</p>

<p>But his mother, who lived quite on the
other side of the field, heard him cry, and
she came jumping on to the cucumber-frame
with such a bounce that she broke the glass
and tumbled in. “Come home this minute,”
she said. “I’ll teach you to run away from
home.”</p>

<p>As she took him past the strange
rabbits they all called out: “Hullo, Stuck-up,
where are you off to?”</p>

<p>“He’s going home to his father and
mother,” said Mrs. Bunny.</p>

<p>“But he said his father and mother
were Belgian hares.”</p>

<p>“Belgian fiddlesticks!” said his mother.
“I’ll teach him to be ashamed of his
family!” So she took him home by the
ear. He’s quite a different bunny now, and
works hard to support his old father and
mother, as all good rabbits should.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">TOMMY was a terrible
tease, and poor little Mamie
came in for most of the
teasing.</p>

<p>Tommy wasn’t really an
unkind little boy, but he
was very thoughtless, and
very often he led Mamie
into all sorts of scrapes.
One day he persuaded her
to play at Indians with him;
he screwed up her hair into
tight knots, made her shut
her eyes and then blacked her face. When
the little girl looked in the mirror over the
mantelpiece and saw how ugly she was, she
ran out of the room, meaning to go to
Nurse to be washed clean again; but Tommy
ran after her, and, just as she was passing
the drawing-room door, he gave her a push,
and in she went, right into the middle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a group of ladies who were visiting her
Mamma. Oh! how angry Mamma was, for
she thought Mamie had done it on purpose.</p>

<p>But what hurt Mamie’s feelings the
most was the way in which Tommy treated
her dolls. He didn’t like dolls himself, and
he couldn’t understand how his sister <i>could</i>
love a silly wax thing. But she did. She
thought Rosalind was the sweetest and loveliest
of babies.</p>

<p>One day Tommy bought a penny squirt.
He played for a long time at storms at
sea with it, sailing his boat on a big pan
of water that stood out in the garden, and
squirting at it until it sank.</p>

<p>But he grew tired of this, and then
he began to squirt Rosalind, as she lay
cuddled up in Mamie’s arms.</p>

<p>Poor Rosalind! Mamie tried hard to
protect her, but in vain. “It’s only an
April shower,” said Tommy, laughing. “It
won’t hurt her.” But dolly was soon wet
through, and the last remaining bit of pink
on her cheeks came off when Mamie dried her.</p>

<p>The next day Mamie told some of her
friends of her troubles, and the little girls
put their heads together to think how they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
could punish Tommy. “I know,” said Elsie
Martin. And then there was a great deal
of whispering and laughing, after which the
little girls parted.</p>

<p>Tommy was going out to tea that
afternoon, and as he passed the end of
the garden wall, dressed out in his best,
a sudden shower of water was squirted all
over him, spoiling his nice clean suit.</p>

<p>Tommy looked up in astonishment, for
it was not raining; then he heard a great
deal of giggling and someone called out:
“It’s only an April shower; it won’t hurt
you!”</p>

<p>Tommy didn’t say a word, but marched
straight home, for he knew he couldn’t go
to his tea-party as he was. Mamie met him
at the door. “I’m so sorry,” she said, for
she had already begun to repent of what
she had done. “Won’t you forgive me?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Mamie,” said Tommy.
“It served me right, and I’m sorry I
squirted Rosalind, and I’ll never tease you
again.”</p>

Tommy. His Mother sent him
one day into the town to buy
some needles. On his way home
he got tired of carrying them,
so when he saw a hay-cart which he knew
would pass his Mother’s door he stuck the
needles into a bundle of hay. When he
got home his Mother said: “Well, Tommy,
and where are the needles?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Mother, they will be here directly.
I was tired of carrying them, so I stuck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
them into a hay-cart which is coming this
way, and it will soon be here.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you stupid boy, Tommy! you
<i>stupid</i> boy! If you were tired of carrying
the needles you should have stuck them
into your coat.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do better next time, Mother; I’ll
do better next time.”</p>

<p>A few days after, his Mother said:
“Tommy, will you go into the town and
fetch a pound of butter?”</p>

<p>Off went Tommy, bought the pound of
butter, and put it all over his coat. When
he got home his Mother said: “Well,
Tommy, and where’s the butter?”</p>

<p>“I put it all over my coat, but the
sun melted it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you stupid boy, Tommy! You
should have put it on a nice white plate
and covered it with a piece of white paper.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ll do better next time, Mother;
I’ll do better next time.”</p>

<p>A few days after, his Mother said:
“Tommy, Farmer Jones has given us a
little hen. Will you go and fetch it?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes,” said Tommy. Off he went,
fetched the little hen, and put it on a white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
plate; but before he could put a nice piece
of white paper over it, it had flown quite
away!</p>

<p>When he got home, his Mother said:
“Well, Tommy, and where is the little hen?”</p>

<p>“Oh! Mother, I did what you told me;
I put it on a white plate, but before I
could cover it with a piece of paper it flew
quite away.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you stupid boy, Tommy! You
stupid boy! You ought to have put it in
a wicker basket and shut down the lid.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do better next time, Mother; I’ll
do better next time.”</p>

<p>A few days after, his Mother said:
“Tommy, there is a plum pudding for dinner.
Go and fetch a pound of brown sugar.”</p>

<p>Off went Tommy, bought the pound of
sugar, and put it in a wicker basket, and
shut the lid down tight. When he got
home his Mother said: “Well, Tommy, and
where’s the sugar?”</p>

<p>“Here it is, Mother, here it is.” And
he opened the basket, but it was quite
empty, for all the sugar had tumbled through
the holes in the wicker-work!</p>

<p>“Oh! you stupid boy, Tommy! You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
should have put the sugar in a paper bag
and tied a piece of string very tightly
round it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do better next time, Mother; I’ll
do better next time.”</p>

<p>Some time after, his Mother said:
“Tommy, Farmer Jones has promised us
a dear little puppy dog. Will you go and
fetch it?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes,” said Tommy. So off he
went, fetched the little puppy dog, put it
in a paper bag, and tied a piece of string
<i>very</i> tightly round its neck. When he got
home and opened the bag, the poor little
puppy was quite dead.</p>

<p>“Oh! you stupid boy, Tommy! You
stupid boy! You should have tied a string
quite loosely round the little dog’s neck,
and let it run after you, and you should
have called, 'Hi, little dog!’”</p>

<p>“I’ll do better next time, Mother,” said
Tommy, crying.</p>

<p>A long time after, his Mother said:
“Tommy, will you go into the town and
fetch a leg of mutton? Now, mind you
bring it home very carefully.”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes,” said Tommy. So off he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
went, bought a leg of mutton, tied a piece
of string round it, and dragged it after him
on the ground, and said: “Hi, little dog!
Ho, little dog!” and all the little dogs in
the town came after him and ate the mutton,
and when he got home there was nothing
left but the bone!</p>

<p>When his Mother saw it, she said:
“Really, Tommy, you are <i>too</i> stupid; you
really are <i>quite</i> a goose.”</p>

<p>A little while after, Tommy was nowhere
to be found. His Mother hunted everywhere
for him; she cried “Tommy!” here
and “Tommy!” there, but she could not find
him. As she was coming through the yard
and crying and calling, “Tommy! where’s
my boy Tommy?” she heard a little voice
that seemed to come from the poultry-house:
“Here I am, Mother; here I am!”</p>

<p>She opened the door, and there was
Tommy sitting on the goose’s nest. She
asked him what he was doing, and he said:
“Oh! Mother, you said I was quite a
goose, so I thought I had better come and
sit on the goose’s nest, and I’ve broken all
the eggs!”</p>

<p>Wasn’t he a silly boy?</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“WHERE are you off to, children?”
said Mother. She was just
stepping into the carriage to
pay a round of visits when
Geoffrey and his sister came running out
of the house in a state of breathless excitement.</p>

<p>“We’re going down to the river to sail
my ship, Mother,” said Geoffrey. “I’ll look
after Rosie and see that she comes to no
harm.”</p>

<p>“My dear boy, I couldn’t think of
letting you go by yourselves,” said Mother.
“Father will be home to-morrow, and then
he will take you,” she added, as she saw
the children’s eager faces begin to cloud
over. Then she kissed them both, got into
the carriage, and drove away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;">
<img src="images/illus043.jpg" width="426" height="564" alt="Geoffrey and new ship with Rosie walking beside him" />
</div>

<p>“It’s a jolly shame!” said Geoffrey
crossly. “As if we should come to any
harm! Why, I’m as well able to take care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a><br /><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
of you as Father. Of course I shouldn’t
let you fall in.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s no use,” sighed Rosie; “we
can’t go, so we may as well think of something
else to do.”</p>

<p>A rebellious frown gathered on Geoffrey’s
face. “I’m going to the river,” he said;
“I shall only stay a few minutes to see
how the 'Dancing Polly’ sails. Mother
will never know!”</p>

<p>Rosie hesitated a minute, but when
she saw Geoffrey running down the drive
without her, it was too much, and off she
went after him.</p>

<p>For a whole hour the children spent
a most delightful time sailing the “Dancing
Polly,” but alas! the crew, which consisted
of a wooden doll, fell overboard, and in
stretching over to rescue it Rosie lost her
balance and toppled into the river.</p>

<p>Geoffrey shrieked for help. “Rosie’s
drowning! Rosie’s drowning!” he cried, and
in a moment someone came dashing down
the bank, there was a plunge, a moment
of dreadful suspense, and then Rosie was
lying on the grass with Father standing
over her. Yes, it was Father, who was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a captain in the Royal Navy, and who
had come home from sea a whole day
before he was expected.</p>

<p>“However did your Mother come to
let you two mites go off to the river by
yourselves?” said Father on their way home.</p>

<p>Geoffrey hung his head for a moment,
and then, like a brave little man, he told
his Father all the truth.</p>

<p>“Ah! Geoff, my boy,” said his Father,
“you’ll never make a sailor if you can’t
obey orders!”</p>

<p>And what did Mother say?</p>

<p>Why, not one angry word, for no
sooner did Geoffrey see her than he burst
into tears, and Mother put her loving arms
round him and whispered: “My darling, I
<i>know</i> you won’t disobey me again!”</p>

<p>And Geoffrey never did.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THERE was once a beautiful white
Lily who lived in a green garden,
and had all the happiness of sun
and dew that can come into a
flower’s life. Only one thing saddened her;
now and then the gardener would come
and gather some of her sisters: he took
them away, and she never saw them again.
One dreadful day the gardener came with
a sharp knife and cut the Lily’s stalk and
carried her away in his hand. As she
went she shed bitter tears, and the gardener
said: “What a lot of dew there is in this Lily!”</p>

<p>When she was brought to the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
she was placed in a tall green vase and
set by the bedside of a little sick child.
When the child saw her beauty his tired
eyes lighted up with pleasure, and he cried:
“Oh, the dear Lily! Mother, when can I
go out to see the other lilies growing?”
And from that moment he began to get better.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 406px;">
<img src="images/illus047.jpg" width="406" height="320" alt="gardeher by gate" />
</div>

<p>“It was the Lily did it,” said his Mother,
with tears of happiness. “He was so tired
that if the Lily had not come to cheer
him, he might have gone to sleep and
never wakened here again.”</p>

<p>The Lily tried hard not to fade. She
held herself up bravely, and day by day
the sick child looked at the Lily and grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
stronger and stronger. And at last a day
came when he was well enough to be taken
into the garden to see the lilies growing,
and when he was gone the Lily drooped
and drooped, for she felt that the end of
her pretty green and white life was near.
But though she was sad, she was not sorry,
for she felt that she had done some good
with her life. And as she drooped there
a white butterfly came fluttering in. “Oh,
happy Lily!” he cried. And she looked
sadly at him. “I am not sorry—only sad,”
she said.</p>

<p>“Sad,” he said; “do not you know
what happens to all flowers who are able
to help and comfort any little child? When
they die, they turn into fairies and can
fly for ever through all the green gardens
of the world. The other flowers will only
be flowers next year, but you will be a fairy.”</p>

<p>And as he spoke the Lily died and
became a fairy, and she and the butterfly
spread their white wings and flew out into
the sunshine together.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2">NO one bothered about Charlie;
he was so happy and contented
that the other children
half thought he really <i>preferred</i>
broken toys to whole ones.
He toddled through life with a happy smile
on his face, made a gee-gee of the old
bench in the back-yard, and never once
envied Tommy his fine new Dobbin.</p>

<p>It was not only in the matter of toys
that Charlie failed to receive his just share.
When black Biddy had a brood of seven
chicks, and each of the children claimed
one as a special pet, it was the lame one
that was called Charlie’s. One day, Mother
found her little lad sitting by himself on
the doorstep, with Hopperty, as the lame
chick was called, huddled up in his pinafore.
“What’s the matter, Charlie boy?” said she,
for she noticed that the little cheeks were
very white and the pretty blue eyes heavy.</p>

<p>“My head’s so funny, Mother!” said Charlie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day there were six children
playing in the field behind the house, and
one little boy lay tossing on his bed upstairs.</p>

<p>Now, you would have thought that
amongst so many children one would
scarcely have been missed, but <i>Charlie</i> was.
The children felt as though they could not
play, now that he was not with them.
Then they remembered what a sweet, unselfish
little fellow he had been.</p>

<p>“We gave him the lame chicken!”
said Dora regretfully.</p>

<p>“I never once offered him a ride on
Dobbin,” sighed Tommy.</p>

<p>“I don’t think any of us were <i>very</i> kind
to him,” said Alice. “He was so contented
that we thought anything would do for him.”</p>

<p>The week that Charlie was ill was the
most miserable the children had ever spent,
and when at the end of that time the
Doctor said the worst was over and Charlie
began to mend, there was <i>nothing</i> his brothers
and sisters would not have given him, they
were so thankful. The chickens were secretly
carried up to Charlie’s bedside, but Mother
said she could <i>not</i> have the sick-room turned
into a poultry-yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“But we gave him the lame chicken,”
the children pleaded; “and oh! Mother,
we <i>are</i> so sorry!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mother, “he loves Hopperty
best now; but, my darlings, Charlie will
be down amongst you all soon, I hope,
and then you must remember to try and
be as unselfish to him as he has always
been to you.” The children did not forget
Mother’s words, and as for Charlie, he is
the happiest little boy in the world, and
the other children are all the happier too,
I know, for having learnt to be a little
more like their unselfish little brother.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THIS is a true story, but you
needn’t believe it unless you
like. It happened to a cat
I know, who has never said
anything untrue in her life.
One day when this cat had
gone down to the sea to bathe, she was
standing on the steps of her bathing-machine
looking at the sea and wondering whether
it would be cold—as I daresay you have
often done—when she saw something golden
and gleaming in the water. She thought
it was a fish, and dived into the water
at once. But it was no fish; it was a
yellow sea-cat, with fins and a fish’s tail—a
sort of cat-mermaid.</p>

<p>The cat who told me the story said
that the sea-cat took her by the paw and
led her down into the deep parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
sea and showed her wonderful things. Everything
in the sea-cat’s world is just the
opposite of what it is here. Whatever is
wet here—milk, for instance—is dry down
there; and whatever is dry here—such as
a cat’s bed—is wet there.</p>

<p>But I never allow my friend the cat
to talk much of this adventure. Not because
I don’t believe her; but because I think
it may make her proud if she talks too
long about the wonderful things she saw
there. Anyhow, I don’t see how you can
doubt a cat’s word. A cat hasn’t any words,
do you say? No—that’s just it.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">TOMMY would not learn his
lessons. He wouldn’t do his
sums, he upset the ink over his
geography book, and smashed
his slate. He tore a leaf out of
his grammar and made a paper
boat of it. He ought to have been punished,
but he wasn’t, because his Mamma thought
that dear Tommy must be ill or he wouldn’t
behave so badly; so, thinking the fresh
air would be good for him, she asked him
to pick her a bunch of buttercups out of
the meadow, but Tommy said he would
rather not—he didn’t want to do anything
ever again.</p>

<p>Tommy was not a bad little boy generally,
but sometimes the idle fairy, who is no
bigger than a grain of mustard-seed, though
very strong, sat in his ear and whispered
naughty things to him. He threw all his
lesson-books in a heap on the school-room
floor, and went out to the orchard, where
he ate seven big apples one after the other,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and lay on his back looking up at the
apple-trees, and trying to feel glad that he
had had his own way. Presently he sighed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 537px;">
<img src="images/illus055.jpg" width="537" height="492" alt="Fairy watching Tommy tried to get a ball" />
</div>

<p>“What do you want?” said a voice,
and Tommy saw a little red-cheeked man
in a green cap, swinging on one of the
apple boughs and looking at him.</p>

<p>“I only want to do nothing,” whined
Tommy; “it’s very hard they won’t let me.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, if that’s all,” said the little man,
“come with me,” and, taking Tommy’s hand,
he led him through a convenient little door
which opened in the trunk of the apple-tree.
It led straight into the most beautiful
garden in the world.</p>

<p>“Now then,” said the little man, “do
nothing as hard as you like.” And he
plumped Tommy down on a grassy bank.</p>

<p>Presently a troop of merry children
came by with balls and hoops. Tommy
jumped up to catch a golden ball that
rolled his way.</p>

<p>“Lie down, sir,” said the little man,
for all the world as though he had been
a dog, Tommy thought; “you wanted to
do nothing, remember!”</p>

<p>“I meant no lessons,” said Tommy.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 223px;">
<img src="images/illus057.jpg" width="223" height="448" alt="Tommy on a hook" />
</div>
<p>“You didn’t say so,” said the little
man. “Besides, all those children have
done their lessons, or they would not be
allowed to stay here.”</p>

<p>Some more children came by riding
on white ponies. One pony had no rider.
Tommy started up. It would be lovely to
ride that long-tailed pretty little pony.</p>

<p>“Lie down, sir,” said the apple-man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
crossly; “you came here to do nothing and
I’m going to see that you do it.”</p>



<p>“I am doing something anyhow,” said
Tommy suddenly. “I’m
sitting down.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the
apple-man; “we’ll soon
settle that;” and a strong
hook suddenly caught
Tommy by the back of
his clothes and hung him
up in the air. “Now you
are not doing anything,
anyway,” said the little
man; “the hook is doing
the work.”</p>

<p>Imagine being hung
up by a hook just out of
reach of everything, while
long processions of little green men came and
offered you all the things you wanted most in
the world—cricket-bats and ferrets, paint-boxes
and hard-bake, guinea-pigs, catapults, and
white mice, marbles, buns, and sheaves of
letters with valuable foreign stamps on them.
Tommy cried with rage, but the little apple-man
only laughed, and kept saying: “How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
do you like doing nothing, eh!—jolly, isn’t
it?” Then he saw his Mother coming along
the path, and to his horror he saw that a
leopard was slinking after her. He called
aloud, but she did not hear.</p>

<p>“Oh, let me go and drive the leopard
away,” he cried to the little green man; “it
will eat my Mammy—I know it will. Oh,
Mammy, Mammy!” but she did not hear,
and the little man said: “Oh, nonsense! if
you haven’t got the pluck to master a simple
addition sum, you can’t master a leopard,
you know”; but Tommy struggled so hard
that the hook gave way and he fell with a
bounce on the orchard grass. He rushed off
to find his Mother. To his delight she was
safe, and there was no leopard about in the
house or garden.</p>

<p>He threw his arms round her neck.
“Mammy,” he said, “I do love you so.
I’ll learn everything and do everything you
tell me.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” thought his Mother, “the fresh
air has done him good.”</p>

<p>But it was not the fresh air; it was
the little apple-man.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">TODDLES was a greedy
boy. If ever he had a cake
or and orange, he would
go away by himself to eat
it, so that he might not
have to give any away. He
was a <i>very</i> greedy boy.</p>

<p>One day he sat on the fence at the end
of his mother’s garden eating a slice of bread-and-butter,
and an old crow flew down from a
tree close by and looked at the food longingly.</p>

<p>“I’m hungry,” said the crow, for Toddles
lived in the land where birds can talk.
“Give me a few crumbs of your bread.”</p>

<p>But the greedy boy took no notice; he
just went on eating the bread-and-butter
and never offered the bird a crumb. Then
the hungry crow turned upon him angrily,
and pecked his bare legs until he screamed
with pain. Down the garden path ran
Toddles, and the crow ran after him. At
each step the boy seemed to dwindle and
grow smaller, whilst the crow grew and grew,
until he was larger than the largest eagle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Then he made a peck at Toddles, caught
him up in his beak, and flew away with him,
and put him into a cage that hung from
the topmost branch of the tallest tree. “There
you shall stay,” he said, “until you have
learned to be a better boy.”</p>

cage, and Toddles cried and screamed until
he made himself quite ill, and the crow sat
on the branch beside him and teased him
and laughed at him the whole day long.
When the next morning came, the bird gave
him a piece of bread and left him. He had
just begun to eat it, when a little voice
beside him piped, “Give me a crumb!”</p>

<p>It was a little Jenny Wren, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
looked so pitifully at the boy that he broke
off a corner of his food and gave it to her.
Toddles could have eaten it up in no
time, he was so hungry, but just as he
had commenced he heard a little dog
barking on the ground below. It was a
thin, starved little creature, and Toddles,
whose heart was growing much softer, broke
his morsel of bread in two, and threw half
to the dog. The next morning the little boy
was very hungry indeed, and the food that
was given him was less than ever. Just as
he was going to eat it, he heard a child
crying, and, peeping between the bars of his
cage, he saw a little hungry child. She had
had no food for days, she said, and Toddles
was so sorry for her that he dropped her
the whole of his breakfast. Then the crow
came swooping back, opened the door of the
cage, and taking the little fellow in his beak,
flew back with him to his mother’s garden,
and dropped him on the fence where he had
first found him.</p>

<p>“You have learnt your lesson, Toddles,”
said he, “so there is no need to punish you
any more.” And Toddles <i>had</i> learnt a lesson,
for he was never greedy again.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">“WILL you get out of my way,
lumbering elf? This is the
third night I have tumbled
over you.”</p>

<p>“Softly, good Father Sandman,
softly! If you were not so
blind you would have seen me.
Have you put all your children
to bed, old Father Sandman?”</p>

<p>“Go along for a teasing, impertinent
imp!”</p>

<p>Pipistrello laughed shrilly as he swung
himself to and fro on the branch of a low
shrub, chanting—</p>

<p>“Close, little eyelids, close up tight, for
the Sandman’s come to town!”</p>

<p>The old fellow had gone into his cave;
it was nearly dark now. Boum! An old
brown shoe came flying out, and, catching
the elf as he swung, toppled him neatly
on to the grass beneath. He was not hurt,
for the Sandman goes very softly shod, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the children may not hear him. But he was
extremely angry. “Very good!” he cried,
shaking his morsel of a fist; “to-day you,
Father Sandman, and to-morrow me! Mark
my words, you will be sorry for it before
the moon is many nights older.”</p>

<p>A chuckle was heard coming from the
cave, and that was all. Pip went off, meditating
revenge. In the middle of supper he
snapped his fingers gleefully. “The very
thing,” he cried; and he began to hum;
“Close, little eyelids, close up tight, for
the Sandman’s come to town!”</p>

<p>Old Father Sandman was hunting about
his cave in a fine state of mind. “Ach!
where is my bag of sand? Where can it
have gone? It is the children’s bedtime;
the Nurses and the Mammas will be wondering
where I am! My sand-bag, my precious
sand-bag—oh, if I could but find it!” The
poor old gentleman trotted to and fro, and
seemed nearly distracted.</p>

<p>“I wish I could help you,” said a bat,
who generally shared his cave; “I have
been asleep all day, you know, and have
seen no one.”</p>

<p>“If you will let me ride on your back,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
cried the old fellow eagerly, “I might catch
my brother Sandman, who lives the other
side of the wood, before he goes out. He
would lend me some sand, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“Come along then,” said the bat.</p>

<p>But the second Sandman declined to
help. Poor Father Sandman got back to
his cave, and there was Pip swinging on
the same branch as before, and looking
very malicious. “I believe,” gasped the old
gentleman, “that it is you that stole my
sack!”</p>

<p>Pip laughed, and skipped out of reach,
crying: “My turn to-day, Father Sandman.”</p>

<p>But although mischievous, he was not
a bad-hearted sprite, and presently he went
and fetched the sand-bag. Then he made
a bargain. “Father Sandman, will you say
you are sorry?”</p>

<p>“Pipistrello, I will say I am sorry,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>“And you won’t bear malice?”</p>

<p>“I will not bear malice—give me my
bag.”</p>


<p>“One thing more. Will you let all the
children sit up half an hour longer in winter,
and an hour in summer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>“It can’t be done—well, perhaps, if I
must—yes, then; but the babies must go
to bed a quarter of an hour earlier all the
year round.”</p>

<p>“Please yourself about the babies,” said
Pip. “Catch, Father Sandman!”</p>

<p>The next minute the old fellow, with
his sack on his back, and a smile on his
face, was trotting off to the town.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi3">YOU mustn’t go into the morning-room,
Dodo—don’t forget, will
you?</p>

<p>“No, Mother,” Dodo answered,
but she didn’t seem
very pleased. It happened that she was a
very curious little girl, and always liked to
know what was going on, and she was quite
certain that something interesting was taking
place now.</p>

<p>Mary and Eric had just come out of
the morning-room, whispering together, and
if Eric, who was younger than Dodo, might
go in, she thought it was very unkind of
Mother not to let her.</p>

<p>Dodo was so cross that she sulked
nearly all the afternoon, and was so tiresome
when nurse was dressing her to go
down to the drawing-room, that the other
children were ready long before she was.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/illus067a.jpg" width="370" height="600" alt="full color picture of Dodo with her back against a door and a little dog in front of her" />
</div>

<p>But at last she trotted downstairs, with
Spot at her heels—Spot <i>always</i> waited for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Dodo—and as the two of them passed the
morning-room door, they both stopped.</p>

<p>Strange to say, Spot was quite as curious
as Dodo. He sniffed at the door, and whined,
and wagged his short stumpy tail violently
to and fro. The little girl’s hand was on
the handle of the door. Should she turn
it? Surely one little peep <i>couldn’t</i> matter?</p>

<p>It always seemed to Dodo that the
handle turned of its own accord. <i>I</i> don’t
think it could have done so, but at any
rate the door opened a little way, and out
dashed a fluffy white kitten. In an instant
Spot was after it, and chased it down the
hall and out into the garden.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;">
<img src="images/illus069.jpg" width="512" height="190" alt="Spot chasing kitten" />
</div>

<p>Dodo didn’t know what to do; she
couldn’t very well run after Spot, because
just at that moment Mary called her.</p>

<p>“Be quick, Dodo; Mother wants you,”
she said. So Dodo went into the drawing-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
feeling very guilty, and soon afterwards
Spot came in, licking his lips.</p>

<p>“Had he eaten the kitten?” his mistress
thought, but she didn’t <i>dare</i> say anything.</p>

<p>The next morning when Dodo came
down to breakfast, she found all sorts of
nice presents laid out beside her plate.</p>

<p>“They can’t be for me,” she said, but
Mother kissed her and said:</p>

<p>“Yes, they are, my pet. You surely
haven’t forgotten that it is your birthday?
I am so sorry that I have no present for
you, but yesterday I bought you a little
white kitten and shut it up in the morning-room.
Some one must have let it out, for
we can’t find it anywhere.”</p>

<p>You can think how Dodo felt then.
She grew redder and redder, and then she
burst out crying. After that she did the
best thing she could have done. She told
Mother all about it, and Mother kissed
and comforted her, and forgave her, but
she made her promise to try and not be
so curious or so disobedient again.</p>

<p>And before breakfast was over, what do
you think happened? Dick, the gardener’s
boy, brought in a lovely white Persian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
kitten, that he had found in the tool-house.
Of course, it was Dodo’s, and it was the
very sweetest and dearest kitten in the world.</p>

<p>Spot was inclined to be jealous of the
new pet, and was very naughty at first,
barking and snapping at it in a very rude
manner; but in the end even <i>he</i> couldn’t
help liking the pretty little fluffy thing.
Before a week had passed he and Snow
became the very best of friends, and he
wouldn’t have chased that kitten for the
meatiest bone in a whole butcher’s shop.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THERE were once two little white
rats who lived in a hutch with
wide bars. They had plenty of
soft hay to sleep in, and bread-and-milk
at the proper times. But they were dull,
for they never saw the world, and they
had nothing to talk of in the long winter
evenings. One winter day a Fairy knocked
at their door.</p>

<p>“I am cold and hungry,” she said,
“and Fairyland is a long way off; I can
never get there in this snowy weather.”</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Mrs. Whiterat, and
the Fairy crept in through the bars. Mr.
Whiterat gave the Fairy some bread-and-milk,
and Mrs. Whiterat sat close beside
her in the hay—so that soon the Fairy felt
quite warm and cheerful again. And she
lodged with the white rats all the winter,
and they were all three as happy as could be.</p>

<p>Then when spring came, and the daffydowndillies
were waving their yellow heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in the sun, the Fairy said: “I must go
home now. You have been very good to
me. You may have three wishes.” And
she waved her little wand and flew away.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 335px;">
<img src="images/illus073.jpg" width="335" height="386" alt="Mr. and Mrs. Whiterat" />
</div>

<p>Now, the white rats had often longed
to be free, to run about under the haystacks,
and bring up large lively families,
like the brown farm rats. So now they
said—</p>

<p>“Oh! I wish we were out of the hutch!”
And in a minute they found themselves
among the hayricks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh! how big and beautiful the world
is,” they said.</p>

<p>And then a dreadful thing happened.
A great brown rat jumped out at them.</p>

<p>“Get along with you!” it said. “We
don’t want any toy-rats here.” And it showed
its sharp teeth and looked so fierce that
Mrs. Whiterat trembled to the end of her
grey tail, as she cried out—</p>

<p>“Oh! I wish we were safe in the hutch!”
And the same instant, there they were at
home again.</p>

<p>And the third wish? Well, they haven’t
made up their minds about that yet. It
gives them something to talk about in the
winter evenings!</p>

<p class="drop-capi">MR. and Mrs. Stoat lived with
their children in a comfortable
home. They were very well off—they
always had plenty to eat, and their
fur coats always fitted beautifully and were
never shabby.</p>

<p>Every day, when Mrs. Stoat was busy
with the house work, she used to send
the children out for a walk, and one day,
when the children were walking in the
wood, they saw two ladies coming down
the path.</p>

<p>The little Stoats hid in a hole in the
mossy root of a tree, and as the ladies
went by, one of them said: “I wonder what
fur will be worn next winter?”</p>

<p>“They say,” answered the other lady,
“that nothing will be worn except——”</p>

<p>But the little Stoats could not hear
what fur it was that was to be worn next
winter. They did not like to think of other
people wearing fur, for fear their own fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
coats should be taken from them. “Oh!
how cold we should be without our coats!”
they said, shivering; but then the most
sensible Stoat said: “It can’t matter to us
what big people wear! Our coats wouldn’t
fit <i>them</i>, you know.”</p>

<p>But the smallest Stoat of all felt quite
anxious to know what fur would be worn,
because she was a vain little person, and
felt it would be very sad if Stoat-fur coats
were not the fashion.</p>

<p>So when she went home to dinner she
asked Mrs. Stoat the question.</p>

<p>“Mother dear, you know everything.
Do tell us what fur will be worn next winter.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 365px;">
<img src="images/illus077.jpg" width="365" height="600" alt="Color picture of two children in a garden" />
</div>

<p>“Why, Stoat-fur, of course,” the Mother
answered, laughing; “unless——” She stopped
short and looked at Mr. Stoat, who nodded
and then they both laughed, and everyone
sat down to dinner. But that silly smallest
Stoat of all couldn’t sleep for thinking of
that “unless.” What could it mean but
that perhaps some other fur would be worn?
And then <i>unfashionable!</i> It was a dreadful
thought. Before morning she had made up
her mind to go out into the great world
and find out what fur was to be worn next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
winter. So she said nothing to anybody,
but she started off alone; and perhaps she
would soon have seen how silly she was
and have come running back again, but,
alas! she was caught in a trap, and the
keeper who caught her would have killed
her, only his little daughter begged so hard
that the keeper agreed to spare the little
creature’s life. So the smallest Stoat of all
was kept in a hutch.</p>

<p>And there she stayed for weeks and
weeks; and when it grew very cold the
hutch was put in the stable, so that she
was always warm; but she longed to get
home again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t think I should care about not
being in the fashion,” she said sadly to
herself, “if only I could go back to my
dear Mammy and the old home!”</p>

<p>Now, one day two ladies took refuge
from a snowstorm in the keeper’s house,
and as they passed the stable the smallest
Stoat of all heard one of them say: “You
see, I was right. Nothing is being worn
but <i>ermine!</i>”</p>

<p>And the little person in the hutch
recognised the voices of the two ladies she
had seen in the wood. So now she had
found out the great secret! And it so
happened that the very next day someone
left the door of her hutch open, and she
slipped out very cautiously, lifting up her
little head and turning it from side to side,
and sniffing to make sure that there was
no danger near.</p>

<p>Then she started to run across the
snowy fields to her old home. But as she
ran she heard feet behind her—and ran
faster and faster—a little brown streak on
the snow. And the feet came faster too.
They were a dog’s feet—and she heard the
dog’s quick breathing close behind her as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
she rushed into the old home, and knew
she was safe. As soon as she had got over
her fright enough to look about her, she
received another shock; she was in the midst
of a number of strangers all dressed in
creamy white fur dresses who were only
like her as to their neat black tails.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
<img src="images/illus079.jpg" width="417" height="327" alt="Little Stoat runs into her family who are all dressed in ermine" />
</div>

<p>“I’m sure I beg your pardon,” she
said; “I thought this was the house where
my Father and Mother lived.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” cried the white furry people,
laughing. “Don’t you know us?” And then
she saw that these were really her own
relations, only their dresses were new.</p>

<p>“We are wearing ermine now,” said
Mrs. Stoat proudly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother, can’t I have an ermine
dress too?” cried the youngest Stoat of all.
“Nothing is being worn but ermine. I
heard them say so.”</p>

<p>“Something else is being worn by <i>you</i>,
at any rate,” said Mrs. Stoat sternly. “You’ve
been living in some warm nasty place. If
you’d stayed here in the cold like a good
little Stoat, instead of running away from
home, you would have had an ermine dress
like everyone else.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t you know, silly child,” said
Mr. Stoat, “that we always get ermine coats
in very cold winters? Then dogs can’t see
us so well in the snow. It’s very cold still.
If you try hard perhaps you can get an
ermine coat like the rest of us.”</p>

<p>But the smallest Stoat of all never
got her ermine coat, for the spring came
quite soon, and there has not been a really
hard winter since.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">NELL had disappeared, and
no one could find her anywhere.
Poor Baby cried
till his pretty eyes were
all swollen and red, for Nell
was his favourite playmate,
and he missed her dreadfully.</p>

<p>“Never mind, old man,”
said Mother, kissing him.
“She’ll come back again some
day.” And so she did.</p>

<p>One day a little half-starved ragged-looking
dog came creeping up to the nursery,
and Baby uttered a shout of joy. “Mamma,
Mamma,” he cried, “Nell’s come back.”</p>

<p>The good little dog licked Baby’s hands
and face, and wagged her tail by way of
saying, “How are you, darling Babs, after
all this long time?”</p>

<p>But, when Mother set a dish of food
before her, she gobbled it up in no time,
and then, scarcely waiting to say “Thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
you,” she ran out of the nursery, downstairs,
and after that no one knew what
had become of her, for she was lost again.</p>

<p>However, the next day she came back
again, and the next, and the next, and one
fine morning she trotted up to the nursery,
dragging with her the sweetest little puppy
you ever saw.</p>

<p>Poor doggie! she was very proud of
her little son, but oh! so frightened lest
any harm should come to him.</p>

<p>Mother picked up the fat little fellow
and put him on a chair, and then lifted
Baby up to look, and Nell jumped upon
the chair beside her son, and looked piteously
up into Mother’s face.</p>

<p>“All right, old dog,” said Mother; “I
wouldn’t harm your baby for anything,
because you are always so good to mine.”
Nell understood in a moment what Mother
had said, jumped down from the chair,
and ran towards the door, whining and
looking back.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 440px;">
<img src="images/illus085.jpg" width="440" height="600" alt="Mother, baby and dog" />
</div>

<p>Mother knew she was meant to follow;
so she and Baby went with the little dog,
who led them down the garden towards the
stables, and then up into the hayloft, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a><br /><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
there, behind a large truss of hay, they
found four other dear little puppies, just
like the one Nell had brought to the nursery.</p>

<p>They carried them into the house, and
Baby was allowed to keep one, which he
trained to become a very clever doggie, and
the others were sent to the Home Farm.</p>

<p>And why do you think Nell had kept
her secret so well? She had been afraid
that someone would rob her of her darlings;
so she had hidden them up until they were
old enough to trot about nicely, and were
so sweet and pretty that she was sure no
one would have the heart to harm them.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">HIDE-AND-SEEK is a jolly game
when you play it out of doors
and there are a good many of you;
but when you have to play it indoors and
there are only two of you, you have to
make the dolls play too. Molly and I used
to each be captain of a side; she had nine
dolls and I had only seven; so our side
had much more looking to do than hers.</p>

<p>One very snowy day, when we couldn’t
play in the garden, we had tried all the
games we could think of, and Molly was
getting crosser and crosser because she
could not draw Selina properly, when I
said: “Let’s play hide-and-seek.” Molly
said: “All right, only I don’t know where
half my dolls are. You must lend me some
of yours. I’ll have the talking one and the
one that shuts its eyes.”</p>

<p>I didn’t like this very much, but I
gave in. “And our side will hide first,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
said Molly. I didn’t like that either, but
I gave in again.</p>

<p>I said good-bye to my dear Rosalie
and Selina, and handed them over to Molly;
then I turned my pinafore over my head
and waited while she hid them.</p>

<p>“Cuckoo! cuckoo!” cried Molly, as a
signal that all were hidden.</p>

<p>I soon found Molly; she was behind
the window curtain, and made it stick out,
of course; and I soon found her dolls and
my Selina. Molly had hidden her in the
coal-scuttle, and though she had wrapped
her in a piece of paper, I didn’t think it
was quite nice of her; but I couldn’t find
Rosalie, the squeaking doll, anywhere. I
looked in Nurse’s work-basket, I looked
in the doll’s house, I looked everywhere
you could think of—<i>no</i> Rosalie! Just then
Molly had to go and have her dress “tried on.”</p>

<p>Hide-and-seek is no fun by yourself,
but I couldn’t bear to think of Rosalie
being hidden somewhere all alone, so I
went on looking. It was beginning to get
dark, and Nurse had gone down to her
tea, and I felt very miserable and forsaken,
when suddenly in the quiet Nursery I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Rosalie’s well-known squeak. The dear doll,
she was calling to me! The sound came
from the chest-of-drawers. The drawers
themselves we were forbidden to open, but
I pulled out Nurse’s work-drawer, and there,
lying on the cut-out flannel petticoats, was
my precious Rosalie. What I had so often
wished had come true, no doubt. Rosalie
had squeaked by herself. If she could squeak
she could talk, and what interesting talks
we should have! I told Nurse all about
it when she came up from her tea.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>“Bless you, my lambie,” she said;
“dollies don’t squeak without something to
make them.”</p>

<p>She went to the work-drawer and
pulled it open. Lying curled up at the
back was pussy.</p>

<p>“It was the cat you heard,” said Nurse;
“or perhaps pussy sat on the doll’s squeak.”</p>

<p>It was a dreadful blow, but after all,
I don’t think I quite believed that pussy
had anything to do with it; and for a long
time I used to take Rosalie into quiet
corners whilst Molly was busy making her
dolls new dresses, and beg her to squeak
just a little for me, so that no one else
should hear; but she never did, so that
perhaps Nurse <i>was</i> right after all.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">FAIRIES are all pretty, we know, but
the Twelfth Night Fairy was really
lovely. She wore a white frock and
a wreath of pink roses. She had
no shoes or stockings, and stood on the
tip of one toe and waved the other foot
in the air. Teddy thought she was lovely,
and he felt hungry when he looked at her,
although he had just eaten his supper of
bread-and-butter and milk. How he wished
he were grown up instead of being only
five years old, so that he had to be sent
to bed like a baby, instead of sitting up
for Mother’s party!</p>

<p>“I could eat her every bit; she’s only
sugar,” said Teddy regretfully.</p>

<p>“Never mind, old man,” said Mother;
“you shall have a nice slice of the cake
to-morrow.” So Teddy sighed deeply, mounted
the nursery stairs, and was soon far away
in Dreamland.</p>

<p>But the Fairy went to Dreamland too.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
Teddy met her as soon as he crossed the
threshold, and she told him she had been
running after him ever since he left the
supper-room.</p>

<p>“I wanted to tell you that I’m not
sugar,” she said. “I’m a real live Fairy.
And, oh! please, <i>please</i> don’t eat me! I
heard your Mother say that she would give
me to you, because you had been a good
boy and went to bed without making a fuss.”</p>

<p>There were tears in the Fairy’s eyes,
and she looked so piteously at Teddy that
he felt inclined to cry too.</p>

<p>“I won’t eat you, dear little thing!”
he said, kissing her. “If Mother gives
you to me, I’ll keep you for ever and ever.
But, oh dear! suppose someone else should
eat you before morning?”</p>

<p>This was a dreadful idea, and the Fairy
began to sob outright, so tender-hearted little
Ted thought he would go at once and make
his Mother promise that she would not
let anyone touch the poor little pink-and-white
Fairy.</p>

<p>It was not very far from Dreamland
to the dining-room, and the little boy soon
stood by his Mother’s side, with the bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
light from the waxen candles shining upon
his golden curls and lighting up his pretty
blue eyes. The room was quite full of
people, but Teddy, who was a shy boy
generally, didn’t mind a bit. “Oh! Mother
dear,” he cried earnestly, “<i>promise</i> that no
one shall eat the little Fairy.”</p>

<p>Mother picked him up and kissed
him, and then someone put the Fairy—who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
had followed him downstairs—into
his hand, and in a moment he was fast
asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke in the morning the
first thing he saw was his little friend,
smiling at him from the top of the Nursery
chest-of-drawers.</p>

<p>Teddy <i>was</i> so glad she was safe and
sound, and he wouldn’t have eaten her for
the world now, because, although she looked
so sweet, he knew she was not made of
sugar.</p>

<p>He grew very fond of her and carried
on long one-sided conversations with her.
She never answered him during the day,
but at night she met him very often in
Dreamland, and danced with him, and sang
him the sweetest, quaintest songs, and Teddy
says, when he’s a grown man, he’s going to
marry the pink-and-white Fairy.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'><i>THERE</i> was once a Fairy who
lived in the hollow part of
a quill pen. It was a very pretty
palace for a fairy, with half-transparent
walls. And hers
was a happy life. The only
thing that troubled her was
that the man who used the pen only wrote
logic and grammar and really sensible things.</p>

<p>“Why can’t he write poetry and fairy
stories?” she used to say. “Oh, what beautiful
things this dull man could write if he
only knew that there was a Fairy in his pen!”</p>

<p>So one day when the man who used
the pen had gone to a dull lecture, she
wrote on the blotting-paper:—“<i>There is a fairy
in your pen!</i>” “And now,” she thought, “he
will surely let me help him to write poetry
and fairy stories.”</p>

<p>But the stupid man thought the children
had written the words on his blotting-paper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
so he sent them to bed, and the Fairy
cried till the ink was quite pale from having
so many tears mixed with it.</p>

<p>And the man, finding that his pen
wrote worse and worse, threw it into his
waste-paper basket. His housekeeper picked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
it out. “I’ll mend this pen,” she said,
“and use it for my books.”</p>

<p>“Oh! now,” thought the Fairy, “someone
really is going to write fairy stories
and poetry with me.”</p>

<p>But the housekeeper only used the pen
for adding up the baker’s and butcher’s
bills, and the Fairy got very angry. So
she left the quill pen and came to live
with me. And I try to be kind to her,
and never hurt her feelings by writing
logic or grammar or anything really sensible.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THERE was once a little girl
who was so fond of dancing
that she never did anything else.</p>

<p>She danced whilst she
took her breakfast, so that her
nice bread-and-milk was spilt
upon the ground; she danced on her way
to school, and was late in consequence; she
danced when she took her dinner, and dropped
the soup down her pretty frock and spoilt
it; and even when she was tucked up in
bed at night, her little feet kept dancing up
and down beneath the bed-clothes, and she
dreamt that she was treading a minuet with
the King of the Fairies.</p>

<p>Now, of course this was very wrong
indeed of the little girl. It is all very well
to dance at the proper time, but out of
time and season, as this little girl danced,
it is a very bad thing indeed.</p>

<p>Her mother reasoned with her, coaxed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
her, scolded her; but it was all of no use,
for she danced the more.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 342px;">
<img src="images/illus099.jpg" width="342" height="533" alt="girl" />
</div>

<p>The little girl’s mother was very poor,
and there were ever so many little brothers
and sisters who wanted taking care of, but
she was too selfish to think of anyone but
herself; sometimes her mother would ask
her to take the baby and hush him to sleep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
but she pouted and grumbled and made a
terrible fuss. If she did take him up in
her arms for a while, she kept dancing round
the room with the poor sleepy little fellow,
till she wakened him up, and then he would
scream and cry, and would not be soothed
till his mother took him again.</p>

<p>So you see, the foolish little girl was
of no use to anyone.</p>

<p>One day when she was dancing to
school as usual, she met an old woman
upon the way. And because she stood in
the pathway and the dancing maiden could
not pass her easily, she danced across the
old woman’s toes.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that the old woman
was a fairy, and she was so angry and
offended with the little girl that she determined
to punish her.</p>

<p>“You shall have dancing enough to last
you all the days of your life,” she said, and
with a wave of her wand, she turned her
into a chimney-cowl, which, as everyone
knows, does nothing the livelong day but
whirl round and round till it almost makes
one giddy to watch it. And the next time
you go out for a walk, you have only to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
look upwards to where the chimneys grow,
and you may see for yourself the little
dancing-girl, who was so rude as to tread
upon the fairy’s toes, going whirl, whirl! the
whole day long, whether she will or no.</p>

<p>And the moral of this story is—“Don’t
dance out of time and season, and don’t
tread upon old women’s toes, or there is
no knowing but what you may be turned
into a chimney-cowl also.”</p>

<p class="drop-capi">IT’S a dreadful thing to be a doll,
children are so inconsiderate. I myself
have lost an arm and a leg
through their rough handling, and
once I trembled for the safety of my
head. Master Johnny wanted to play
at Mary Queen of Scots being executed.</p>

<p>I was quite relieved when Dolly said
that Mary Queen of Scots had been very
beautiful and that I could never be made
to look like her; it was not flattering, perhaps,
but it was safe.</p>

<p>They gave up that idea and then Johnny
said they would go out and fly his parachute.
I thought that now I should be left in
peace for a short time, but no! Johnny
caught me up, tied a string round my waist
and fastened me to the end of the parachute,
and then those two cruel children climbed
up to the top of the garden wall and
dropped me over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not altogether unpleasant to sail
through the air with a parachute, but the
bump when you reach the ground is terrible.
I think I must have fainted away, for I
remember nothing more until I found myself
lying on a bed of violets with a tiny little
creature sitting beside me who asked me
how I felt. The string which bound me
to the parachute had broken and I was free
again, but I felt very stiff and uncomfortable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 370px;">
<img src="images/illus103.jpg" width="370" height="600" alt="children releasing parachute off wall" />
</div>

<p>However, I managed to reply politely
to the little elf’s question, and having
explained how I came to be lying there,
on the wrong side of the garden wall, I
added that I trusted I should never have
to go back again. “What!” cried the elf,
“you would really be contented to remain
here always?” I answered that I should,
and he then ran off and consulted with a
group of elves who had been watching us
from a distance.</p>

<p>When he returned he told me that he
and his companions had long been wanting
a queen, and seeing that I was so much
larger and handsomer than they, they had
decided to offer me the crown.</p>

<p>Of course, I was obliged to hesitate for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
a short time—it isn’t good manners to appear
too eager about anything—but I meant to
accept in the end, and was just preparing
a nice little speech, when I was grabbed—yes,
<i>grabbed</i> by a dirty little hand and
thrown over the wall, where Dolly caught
me. Of course it was Johnny—that boy
always was the bane of my life, and it was
like him to spoil all my prospects.</p>

<p>However, Dolly was so glad to have
me back again that I was a little comforted,
though I have never quite got over the shock
of my voyage over the garden wall.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">YOU would never think, to see
the Matches lying so quietly
in their box in the daytime,
that they really have rather a
pleasant life, and very exciting
adventures. But they do. Every
night the Matches creep out of their box
and hide it, and put on pretty paper frocks
and coats, and go and dance with their
friends. That is why you can hardly ever
find a match-box in the dark, and if you
do it is almost always an empty one.</p>

<p>Well, at one of the Match parties a
young wooden Match with a red head fell
in love with the sweetest little Princess of
a Wax Match you ever saw. She wore a
white smooth frock, and her head was
brown.</p>

<p>“How I love you!” said the Red-headed
Match.</p>

<p>“And I you!” said the brown-headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
little lady. “But they tell me your box is
in the kitchen. That is very low.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” said the lover; “I will
come and live with you.”</p>

<p>So when the party was over the two
went to live in the mother-of-pearl box in
the drawing-room. And that was high life
indeed.</p>

<p>But the Queen of the Wax Matches
was very angry.</p>

<p>“She has married beneath her,” she cried;
“off with her head!”</p>

<p>And sure enough at that moment the
housemaid came to light the fire, and she
struck the little white Princess Match against
the bar of the grate, and her brown head
fell off! The wooden Match did not want
to live now his lady was beheaded, so he
pressed forward into the housemaid’s hand—and
she struck him and lit the fire with
him; and what was left of him fell beside
his white lady. So the two faithful lovers
were buried together in the ashes.</p>

was going to make
the tea, she heard a funny,
faint voice from the tea-pot,
crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, please don’t scald
me with the boiling water!
Take me out! Take me out!”</p>

<p>The Mother, greatly astonished, peeped
into the tea-pot—it was one which she had
not used for some time—and saw there a
queer little man, dressed all in green, with
a green cap upon his head.</p>

<p>“How did you get into my tea-pot?”
asked she.</p>

<p>The Mother took him out, and placed
him upon the table. How delighted the
children were to see him trotting round
and round, taking tiny sips from their
cups, and crumbs from their plates!</p>

<p>“Is it a doll, Muvver?” asked Baby.</p>

<p>“A doll, indeed!” exclaimed the little
green man; “I am no <i>doll!</i> Did you ever
see a doll walk, or hear a doll talk? I
am a <i>man!</i>” And he stood on tip-toe and
straightened himself up in such an amusing
fashion that all the children laughed.</p>

<p>When bed-time came, the little green
man was put to bed in the doll’s house.
But early in the morning, Dora was awakened
by something tickling her nose. Opening
her eyes, she saw the green man standing
upon her pillow.</p>

<p>“You darling!” said Dora; “you shall
go into the garden with me, and see my
pretty white rabbits.”</p>

<p>Jumping out of bed, she dressed herself
as quickly as possible; then, with the little
man standing on one hand, and some green
food for her pets in the other hand, she
ran down the garden. When she got to
the hutch, she fed the rabbits with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
nice, fresh, juicy cabbage-leaves, while the
little man looked on with much interest.
The rabbits were very hungry, and when
they had eaten all the leaves, one of them
made a sudden snatch at the little green
man, and ate <i>him</i> up also. Being rather
short-sighted, it mistook the green man
for a leaf.</p>

<p>Such was the sad fate of the little
green man!</p>

<p class='dropcapstory'>“THERE are no fairies,
did you say? Why,
whatever are we coming
to?” said Uncle James.</p>

<p>“But I’ve never seen
one,” said Harry.</p>

<p>“I daresay not, but
what do you suppose makes your ball bounce?
Why, the fairy inside it, to be sure.”</p>

<p>Harry laughed at the time, but afterwards
he couldn’t help thinking about it.
Did fairies really live in india-rubber balls?
If not, what made them bounce?</p>

<p>He thought and he thought and he
thought—and at last he took out the new
brown-handled knife Uncle James had given
him, and he cut a hole in his india-rubber
ball.</p>

<p>“Now I shall know!” he said. And
he looked inside—but he was no wiser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
than before. But that night
when he was in bed he
saw a little lady, with
gray gauze wings, sitting
on his pillow.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much,”
she said, “for letting me
out. A wicked enchanter
shut me and my million
brothers up in balls, and
when we struggle to get
out, the balls bounce.”</p>

<p>Then she vanished.
Next morning Harry
thought he had
only dreamed
about her, so he
ran to his ball;
but there was the hole he had made, and
sure enough the ball never bounced again.</p>

<p>“Because there is no fairy in it,” Uncle
James says.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THE gilt button shone and sparkled
on Tommy’s coat and was absurdly
proud of himself. Tommy
had sewn him there with a piece
of string and a packing-needle,
one morning when his Mother was too busy
with the baby to attend to him. He went
to school with the little boy and listened
with glistening contempt and dignity to all
the master had to say. He had a very
small opinion of the master, for <i>he</i> hadn’t
a gilt button upon his coat, and he couldn’t
understand why Tommy’s heart went pit-a-pit
at such a rate when the schoolmaster
asked him a question. The rest of the
boys rather made fun of Tommy’s button;
but then, of course, that was jealousy on
their part. They would have liked one well
enough themselves; at least, so the button
thought.</p>

<p>At night, when his chubby little master
was fast asleep, with the old coat folded
up tidily on a chair beside the bed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
foolish button began to boast and brag
about his grandeur, and this didn’t quite
please the other buttons. They had lived
on Tommy’s coat much longer than he, and
they didn’t see why he should give himself
such airs. They were quite ready to be
friendly and kind, but they did <i>not</i> want to
be looked down upon, and so in a very
little time they were all quarrelling.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 299px;">
<img src="images/illus115.jpg" width="299" height="449" alt="Tommy sewing the button on his jacket" />
</div>

<p>Presently Tommy’s Mother stooped over
the child’s bed and kissed him. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
very fond of her boy, and with good reason
too, for he was always bright and cheery,
always helpful and loving, and only the poor
overworked woman knew what the little lad
was to her. As she turned from the bed
the glitter of the gilt button on the worn
old coat caught her eye and she smiled at
the sight of Tommy’s tailoring.</p>

<p>“Poor little lad,” she sighed; “it’s a
shame to let him go so shabby,” and she
carried the coat downstairs and began to
mend it neatly.</p>

<p>Now, the very first thing she did was
to cut the gilt button off the coat and put
a sober black one in his place, and it
happened that she let the gilt button fall,
and he rolled away under the hearth and
lay all night long amongst the dust and
ashes.</p>

<p>In the morning little Tommy felt quite
grand in his tidy coat, though certainly he
had a pang when he found his gilt button
had gone. He went downstairs, and, finding
his Mother had overslept herself, set to
work to clean the hearth and light the fire,
and very pleased he was when he saw his
old friend again amongst the ashes. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
slipped him into his trousers pocket, and
there the button lived for many a long day.
Tommy grew to really love him, and wouldn’t
have parted with him for anything. When
rich boys jingled the pennies in their pockets,
Tommy shook up the gilt button against a
piece of slate-pencil, and it sounded <i>almost</i>
as well.</p>

<p>And what did the gilt button think
about it? He <i>liked</i> it; yes, he really did—at
least, as soon as he got used to the
dark depths of the trousers pocket. He found
out, don’t you see, that Tommy loved him,
and everyone knows, the wide world over,
that it is better, yes, a thousand times better,
to be loved than to be admired.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">THERE was once a Fairy who lived
in a big library. It was rather
a dull place to live in, but the
Fairy liked quiet. One day the
room suddenly grew noisy, and the Fairy
peeped out from behind the poetry-book
where she lived, and saw two children
playing. They were building a house with
the big books, a solid calf-skin house, with
a vellum roof.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 317px;">
<img src="images/illus119.jpg" width="317" height="561" alt="fairy" />
</div>

<p>“This would be a nice house for me,”
said the Fairy, “rather large perhaps, but
I like plenty of room. That poetry-book
was too thin!” So she crept under the
roof, which was made of a volume of Rollin’s
Ancient History. Her new house was rather
musty, but it was large and comfortable.
She was just settling down when a prim
little girl leading a fat dog came into the
room and scolded her little brother and
sister, shut up the Ancient History, put it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
up back on the shelf, and the Fairy was shut
in it. She had to make herself very small, I
can tell you, so as to be comfortable between
the pages. But she did it, and then went
to sleep. “I shall wake when they open
the book again,” she said, and so she did.
But the book was not opened again for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
years and years and years. And at last it
was opened by a learned Professor, and he
read in it through his spectacles, but he
didn’t see the Fairy.</p>

<p>“Why,” she said, “you’re the little boy
who once built a house with the books.”</p>

<p>“Am I?” said the Professor, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you remember?” said the
Fairy, and she flew on to his shoulder and
began whispering in his ear. But he thought
it was his own thoughts. And he remembered
old times, and how he had played and enjoyed
himself when he was a child; but
now he had grown learned, and had been
to Oxford, and had been made a Professor,
he had forgotten how to play. “Heigho!”
he said, “learning isn’t everything. I wish
I were young again.”</p>

<p>“I can do that for you,” said the Fairy.
“How old are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m not thirty yet,” he said.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll make him young,” she said
to herself, “in return for his letting me
out of that dreadful book. Look out of
the window,” she said to him. And again
it seemed to him that it was his own
thoughts he heard. And through the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
he saw the little girl he used to play with,
only now she was grown a fair lady, and
suddenly he grew young again, and went
out to her. And she met him with a
smile, and they went out into the fields
and picked buttercups and daisies, and
came back and had strawberries and cream
for tea.</p>

<p>“It’s good to be young again, my love,”
said the Professor.</p>

<p>And the Fairy kept him young to the
end of his days.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">ONCE upon a time there was a
little girl named Nettie, who
lived with an Aunt and cousin.
She was very unhappy, for her
naughty cousin used to tell falsehoods
about her, which the Aunt
believed. Poor Nettie was constantly being
punished for faults which she had not committed,
but she was so patient and obedient
that her Aunt’s heart was touched at last.
“Nettie does everything that I tell her,”
said the woman to her daughter; “I do
not think that she can be such a very bad
girl, after all.”</p>

<p>“I know of something she could not
do,” said Nettie’s spiteful cousin; “only
let me try her!”</p>

<p>“Well, just this once you may,” replied the
girl’s Mother; “but if she does <i>not</i> fail, I shall
not allow you to tease or worry her again.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they called Nettie, and told her
that she must go into the wood and gather
a bunch of violets. In spring-time, this
would have been an easy task, but it was
now mid-winter. Poor Nettie, in a miserably
thin frock, wandered forth, shivering and
crying. She knew that she should find no
violets in such weather, yet she dared not
return without them. What was she to do?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 487px;">
<img src="images/illus123.jpg" width="487" height="371" alt="Nettie freezing and approaching brothers 'round fire" />
</div>

<p>Presently she saw in the distance a
bright gleam as of flame. “What can that
be?” said Nettie to herself; “I will go and
see.” So she went in the direction of the
light, and came soon to a fire, around which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
were twelve men, each seated upon a big
stone. The oldest of these men—a very
old fellow indeed, whose white beard swept
the ground—spoke kindly to the little girl,
asking her who she was and what she wanted.
Nettie told her sad story. All the men felt
very sorry for her, and the oldest one said:
“My name is January. You cannot find violets
in my month. Yet I think I can find a way
to help you.” Then he turned to one of his
brothers, and said to him: “Suppose you
change places with me, Brother March?”</p>

<p>Brother March jumped up at once, and
changed places with his eldest brother. As
soon as he had done this, a wonderful change
took place in everything. The snow vanished,
the sun shone, the air grew softer, the trees
began to bud. Nettie forgot her troubles as
she saw a bird alight on the grass at her
feet, and close to the spot was a bed of the
loveliest violets she had ever seen.</p>

<p>She thanked the kind brothers and
returned to her Aunt’s house. The violets
must surely have been magic flowers, as
from that day Nettie was well and kindly
treated by her Aunt, and even her cousin
ceased to torment her.</p>

<p class='dropcapstory'>THERE were two robins in
the orchard hedge last
Spring. They had a dear little
nest, and two bluey eggs, and
they were as happy as anyone
need wish to be.</p>

<p>But one day a Boy came
by, and he went off with the
two eggs in a pill-box. Then the
little robins sat and cried all night.</p>

<p>But when they looked into the nest
in the morning they saw where the two
bluey eggs had been a small pink egg—the
colour of apple-blossoms.</p>

<p>“I shall hatch this egg,” said Mrs. Robin
firmly. “Poor little deserted thing!”</p>

<p>“Take care it doesn’t turn out a cuckoo,”
said her husband.</p>

<p>But when the orchard was all pink and
white with blossom, the egg was hatched,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
and out of it came no cuckoo but a real
live Fairy in a pink gown.</p>

<p>She kissed the Robins again and again.
“You dears!” she said. “A wicked enchanter
shut me up in that pink egg—and you
know the only way to get anything alive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
out of an egg is to hatch it! So you’ve
saved me. And—well, you’ll see.” And she
shook out her gauzy wings and fluttered off.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Robins heard a faint
“Tweet, tweet.” Mrs. Robin flew to the
nest, and there were two baby robins, and
the Pink Fairy was sitting on the edge
of the nest. And hundreds of pink apple-blossom
fairies were crowding round.</p>

<p>“They are your very own babies,” said
the Pink Fairy. “While you were hatching
me, my brothers and sisters stole your eggs
from the Boy, and they’ve been hatched
in Fairyland.”</p>

<p>And that’s why two of the robins in
our orchard sing more sweetly than any
other robins in the world.</p>

<p>They were hatched in Fairyland, you
know, and of course that makes all the
difference.</p>

to seek their fortunes. The

“Ah,” he said, “this is a good
enough fortune for me.” And
he stayed there, and the rats and the mice
who lived in the barn were very much
annoyed. And the second kitten walked in
at the dairy door, and the dairymaid said:
“You pretty tabby thing, you shall stay
with me.”</p>

<p>“That’s good enough fortune,” said the
kitten, and he lives on cream to this day,
and he is so fat that he is quite round.</p>

<p>But our black cat (who was the third
kitten) was more adventurous. He was
running after a young sparrow, and not
looking where he was going, so he fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
plump into a well, and there would certainly
have been an end of him, but that a good-sized
Fairy, who lived in that well, and
happened to want a cat, pulled him out of
the water, and helped him to scramble up
on to a ledge in the well-side.</p>

<p>“Yes,” mewed the kitten, shivering; “if
I must, I must.”</p>

<p>Then the Fairy opened her front door,
which was in the side of the well, and
took the wet kitten into her palace, where
there was a blazing fairy fire. Fairy servants
came and dried the kitten, and gave him
warm milk to drink.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said the kitten, “you are something
like a Fairy. I will be your horse
with pleasure.”</p>

<p>“That’s better,” said the Fairy. “The
willing horse does the most work, but he
gets the most pay too. You shall never
be cold, or hungry, or frightened again.”</p>

<p>And she sent the kitten home at once
by fairy telegraph.</p>

<p>That’s why our black cat sleeps all day.
He has to go out all night for the Fairy
to ride him. He seems just like an ordinary
cat: to look at him, you’d never think he
was the Fairy’s horse. But he is.</p>

<p class="drop-capi">ONCE upon a time there was
a good and beautiful Princess,
who had heard that “Truth”
was at the bottom of a well;
so she went to look for it.</p>

<p>Of course, she did not
know which well, and before
she found the right one she
had got quite tired of being let down in
buckets by long ropes.</p>

<p>But at last she came to a well in the
darkest part of a pine wood, and her heart
told her that here her search would end.
So she looked down, and saw the bright
circle of shining water far, far below.</p>

<p>“But how am I to get down?” she said.</p>

<p>And just then the son of the wood-reeve
came by.</p>

<p>“Shall I go down for you, pretty lady?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“I must go myself,” she answered. “My
fairy goodmother said so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>So she got into the bucket and he lowered
her very carefully. And when she got down
she found that the shining circle she had seen
was not water but a mirror, and on its frame
was written one word—“Truth.”</p>

<p>She came up with the mirror held fast
in her arms, and she thanked the wood-reeve’s
son and went home.</p>

<p>Now, when in due time came suitors
for her hand, the Princess said to each:
“How do you like my mirror?” And one
after the other they looked in the mirror,
and then fled with shrieks of fear.</p>

<p>The King and Queen looked in the
mirror and beheld only their good and
noble faces.</p>

<p>“What frightens the Princes, your
suitors?” they asked.</p>

<p>Then the Princess told them that this
was the Mirror of Truth, and that those
who looked in it saw their own true natures.</p>

<p>“The Princes, my suitors, had wicked
hearts,” she said, “and when they saw their
true selves they were afraid.”</p>

<p>And no good Prince came there to woo,
so the years went on and the Princess was
still unwed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">

</div>

<p>One day, walking in the forest, the
Princess met once again the wood-reeve’s
son, but he was grown a man, and as
soon as the Princess saw him she loved
him. She ran and brought her mirror.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
“Are you afraid to look in it?” she said.
“It is the Mirror of Truth.”</p>

<p>“Why should I be afraid?” he asked.
And he looked in the mirror, and the
Princess, leaning over his shoulder, looked
too.</p>

<p>He started back with a cry. “I am
not like that,” he said. For the mirror had
shown him a face like his own but a
thousand times more beautiful, for it revealed
now the full glory of his noble nature. And
as the Princess looked in the mirror she
read his inmost heart.</p>

<p>“Why, you love me,” she said softly.</p>

<p>“I have loved you ever since I first
saw you,” he said.</p>

<p>And when the King and Queen saw
his face reflected in the mirror they said:
“Take our daughter, for you alone are
worthy of her.”</p>

<p>So they were married, and the wood-reeve’s
son is King of all the land.</p>

<p class='drop-cap'><i>THERE</i> were once some
people who went away
to the seaside, and shut up
their house and sent away
all the servants, and then
left the poor flowers in their
green-house to die of thirst.
The fairies were very sorry
for the poor pretty things.</p>

<p>“Can’t we help them?”
they said, and they flew
round the green-house, looking
at the flowers through the glass, till at
last they found a broken pane in the door.
Then the fairies each got a dew-drop and
flew in with it, but the poor flowers were
so thirsty that the dew-drops were of no
use to them.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear!” the fairies said, “however
can we help them?”</p>

<p>They talked and talked, but could think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of no way. But the most beautiful of the
fairies, who was also the wisest, flew away.</p>

<p>“How unfeeling she is!” said the others.</p>

<p>Next day the flowers in the green-house
drooped more and more, and they were just
murmuring “Water” almost with their last
breath, when the little boy from next door
climbed over the wall. He looked through the
glass at the flowers, and then went in and
watered them. And this he did every day.</p>

<p>“I wonder what made him think of it,”
said all the fairies.</p>

<p>“Why, I did, of course,” said the wisest
and most beautiful. “While you were all
chattering I went and sat on his pillow, and
whispered to him all about the poor flowers
next door. He thought it was a dream, but
we and the flowers know better.”</p>

<p>So when the people of the house came
back from the seaside they found all their
flowers alive and well, and this was certainly
very much more than they had any right to
expect. And the master of the house was so
pleased with the kind care the little boy next
door had taken of the flowers that he gave them
all to him, and got some new ones for himself.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
